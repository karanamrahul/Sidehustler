# Grogu 3D Render in Blender

This repository contains the Blender project files for a 3D rendered model of Grogu from "The Mandalorian". The project demonstrates the application of various textures and shaders to bring a photorealistic aspect to the character model.

## Project Overview

The Grogu 3D render project showcases the application of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) textures to a character model in Blender. The textures include albedo, normal, roughness, ambient occlusion, and emissive maps that come together to create a lifelike representation of the beloved character.

## Renders

- The renders illustrate Grogu in a neutral pose with lighting designed to emphasize the texture work and the model's details.
- Additional renders may include variations in lighting, background, and poses to display the model's versatility.

## Tools Used

- **Blender**: Open-source 3D creation software used for modeling, texturing, and rendering the model.
- **Textures**: High-quality PBR textures applied to the model for realism.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project and run it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Blender

### Installation

1. Download and install Blender from the [official website](https://www.blender.org/download/).
2. Clone this GitHub repository to your machine.
3. Open Blender and navigate to `File > Open`.
4. Locate the `grogu.blend` file from the cloned repository and open it.

## Usage

To view and manipulate the Grogu model:

1. Open the Blender project file.
2. The model should appear in the default scene, ready for rendering.
3. Navigate to the `Shading` workspace to see the applied materials and textures.
4. Switch to the `Rendering` workspace and press `F12` to render the scene.
